This Todo List app is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and allows users to manage tasks effectively. It features:

• Add tasks: Enter tasks and click “Add” to include them in the list.

• Mark as complete: Checkboxes visually track completed tasks.

• Delete tasks: Tasks can be removed with a button click.

• Persistent storage: Tasks are saved in localStorage and remain after refreshing.



How It Works



1. HTML: Structures the app with a form for task input and a dynamic ul for task display.

2. CSS: Provides a clean, modern look with responsive design.

3. JavaScript: Handles interactivity:

• Add tasks: Captures input, validates it, and updates the DOM.

• Render list: Dynamically creates list items with checkboxes and delete buttons.

• Delete tasks: Removes items from the array and updates localStorage.

• LocalStorage: Saves and retrieves tasks to maintain data after page reloads.



What I Learned



• DOM manipulation, event handling, and browser storage.

• Building user-friendly, responsive web apps.
